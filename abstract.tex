Since the introduction of the iPhone also in 2007, billions of people have used a multi-touch interface; but, due to the inaccessibility of most tablet software development kits, very few of these people have ever developed their own multi-touch interactions. This thesis discusses the challenges in developing a toolkit that allows novices to easily make simple touch-interactive projects, while simultaneously empowering experienced users to create complex, personalized multi-touch interactions. Three potential toolkit designs are presented and evaluated using the principle of ``low floors, wide walls, and high ceilings." The toolkits presented have been developed within the context of an upcoming tablet version of Scratch, which aims to allow users of all ages and educational backgrounds (but school-aged children in particular) to easily make and share their own stories, games, and animations on and for the tablet.
