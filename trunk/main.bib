                 pattern is hard and error-prone yet is still the
                 implementation standard in many production environments.
                 We show how to integrate different reactive programming
                 abstractions into a single framework that help migrate
                 from observer-based event handling logic to more
                 declarative implementations. Our central API layer embeds
                 an extensible higher-order data-flow DSL into our host
                 language. This embedding is enabled by a continuation
                 passing style transformation.},

@techreport{ScratchProposal,
  abstract = {The MIT Media Laboratory and UCLA propose to develop and study a new networked, mediarich
programming environment, designed specifically to enhance the development of
technological fluency at after-school centers in economically-disadvantaged communities.
This project will build on our research team’s previous experience and success in two areas: the
development of innovative programming environments for youth, and development of innovative
informal-learning centers for inner-city youth. Our team’s research on “programmable bricks”
has been commercialized as LEGO MindStorms, used by millions of youth around the world.
Members of our research team co-founded the Computer Clubhouse project, a network of afterschool
learning centers for youth from economically-disadvantaged communities. The
Clubhouse network has expanded to 75 sites in 14 countries, with 20,000 youth members, and it
received the prestigious Peter Drucker Award for Nonprofit Innovation.},
