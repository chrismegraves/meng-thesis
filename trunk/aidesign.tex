%Finally, like the previous design, the  Absolute Indexing Design also enables sprites to listen to each of the up-to-ten simultaneous touches. However, touches in this design are indexed in order of initiation relative to all touches that have made since the inception of the project, as opposed to just the current touches. As a result, a touch's associated index can never change in the Absolute Indexing Design, because the $n$th touch pressed in the execution of a project will forever be the $n$th touch pressed.
